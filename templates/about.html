      <p class="lead">
    		Gutenkraft is a non-profit technology research and development (R&D) outfit focused on tackling infrastructure related problems in developing nations. The name is a portmanteau word for 'good strength or good force'. The components of most national infrastructure today are bulky, difficult to deploy and maintain, making it hard for developing nations to provide necessary national facilities. We are working to create and implement a  technology driven blue-print that the developing world could use to address her infrastructure woes and to reduce perpetual reliance on foreign aid. The aim is to drive national growth and advancement for sustainable improvement of living standards, by innovating on and adapting technologies to develop and deploy the necessary building blocks of key growth infrastructures. This is codified in our mission and vision.
