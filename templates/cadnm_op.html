          Our Electronic Design & CAD Operations focuses on cultivating expertise in open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software, enabling both fabless semiconductor development and precision-engineered systems design.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the EDA domain, we prioritize proficiency in industry-standard tools including KiCAD and LibrePCB. For Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/M), we have established FreeCAD as our primary development platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML), particularly in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), have unlocked unprecedented opportunities for enhancing design capabilities. In CAD/M applications, Generative Design enables the rapid creation and evaluation of diverse design solutions based on specified requirements and constraints, facilitating innovative concepts while reducing design cycles and associated costs. Our CAD/M operations maintain a strategic focus on developing expertise in generative design methodologies to leverage AI systems for enhanced innovation and design efficiency.

          The recent breakthroughs with machine learning (ML) especially in Generative Artifical Intelligence (AI), creates a whole new level of possibilities in terms of competence augmentation. In the CAD/M space, <a href="https://formlabs.com/uk/blog/generative-design/" target="_blank"><em>Generative Design</em></a>, which can be used to create and evaluate a wide range of design options based on design requirements(constraints) and objectives, can reveal innovative concepts and reduce time and cost of design.  At Gutenkraft, the CAD&M Op is also focused on developing compentence in the generative design space to leverage AI systems in driving innovation and eficiency in the solution design.
