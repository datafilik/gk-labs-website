            The intent is to create a tool for conducting validated studies in a virtual enviroment for research purpose as well as to inform technology product development.
    
            Also, an alternate version that has a game-play element to it is intended to facilitate game-based-learning (GBL) to help induce undestanding of concepts and ideas key to development of technology products.
