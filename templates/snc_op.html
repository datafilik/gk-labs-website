            This op's key focus is on <em>investigating and developing novel techniques for acquisition, fusion, processing, transmission and reception of telemetric and communcation signals</em> in <b>smart network systems (SNS)</b> and to <em> explore frontiers in the development and deployment of <b>hybridized network architectures</b></em>.  
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Smart networks refer to <em>cognitive networks, smart grids / cities and Industry 4.0 systems etc</em>. The current focus is on enabling the utility of really high frequency bands (such as Millimetre wave (mmWave) & Tetrahertz (THz) wave band) for broadband wireless access in such networks by the application of machine learning (ML) principles and algorithms.
        </p>

            Hybridized networks are modular in nature and operate in a centralized as well as descentralized mode. Blockchain and other peer-to-peer (P2P) systems and protocols already provide proven foundations that can be built upon for creating such systems.
        </p>

            <b>Smart hybridized networks</b> could be crucial to creating robust and self-adapting machine networks that actively takes advantage of the resilence of decentralized systems as well as the efficiency of centralized systems for reliable communication and distributed processing. We refer to such networks as Architecturally Fluid Initiative Networks (ArcFIN) system. ArcFIN is different from automated enterpise networks because of the focus on enabling large scale adaptable network infrastructure using just end or edge devices.
